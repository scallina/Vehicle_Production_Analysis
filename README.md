## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- According to our linear regression summary, vehicle length, ground clearance, and vehicle weight provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. In future tests, spoiler angle and AWD may not need to be considered in the regression analysis. 

- Since the p-value for this test is significant, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis. This model is effective at predicting vehicle fuel efficiency; roughly 68% of miles-per-gallons predictions will be correct under this model.
