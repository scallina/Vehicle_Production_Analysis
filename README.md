## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- According to our linear regression summary, vehicle length, ground clearance, and vehicle weight provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. In future tests, spoiler angle and AWD may not need to be considered in the regression analysis. 

- Since the p-value for this test is significant, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis. This model is effective at predicting vehicle fuel efficiency; roughly 68% of miles-per-gallons predictions will be correct under this model. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

- The design specifications for the client's suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Our data communicates that the 3rd maunfacturing lot in our dataset does not meet this requirement and should be investigated.
